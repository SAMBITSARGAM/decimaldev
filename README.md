So actually yeah this is my new website of my developement, you can even fork and make changes to it. 
The old website codes also available. You can view it by clicking it [here](https://github.com/Scientific-Guy/decimaldev-old)

This website css is half dependent on Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome

This website has following features
- [Guides](https://decimaldev.xyz/guides)
- [Api for guides](https://decimaldev.xyz/guides/decimal-guides-api) 

Thats all features lel. I will add more in future.
Currently i am the only guy(Science Spot) who runs this developement ;)
